# SDAIA_Project( SALECK ) Traffic Congestion Classification using Deep Learning Models
# Problem Description:
This project aims to develop a web application that utilizes deep learning models to classify traffic into three categories:
normal, anomaly, and traffic. By leveraging a dataset of 3700 traffic images sourced from open-source platforms, 
the web app provides users with a user-friendly interface to upload images and view the classification results using the trained deep learning models.

# Project Objectives:
Traffic Classification: Utilize deep learning models (ResNet50V2, DenseNet169, MobileNetV2, CNN) to classify traffic images into normal, anomaly, and traffic categories.
This classification will aid in identifying abnormal traffic situations. 
Web Application Development: Build a web application using the Contuino framework, where can upload traffic images and obtain the classification results using the trained deep learning models.

# Methodology:
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of 3700 traffic images from open-source platforms, ensuring a diverse representation of traffic conditions.
Model Training: Train deep learning models using the collected dataset, focusing on classifying traffic into the three predefined categories.
Traffic Classification Web App: Develop a user-friendly web application using the Contuino framework, allowing users to upload traffic images and view the classification results in real-time.

# Project Deliverables:
Preprocessed dataset of 3700 traffic images for training deep learning models.
Trained deep learning models for traffic classification into normal, anomaly, and traffic categories.
Traffic classification web application developed using the Contuino framework, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading traffic images and viewing classification results.
Documentation and README file on GitHub, providing project information, methodology, data sources, model training, instructions for running the web application, and deployment details.

# This project leverages deep learning models and a dataset of traffic images to develop a web application using the streamlit.
